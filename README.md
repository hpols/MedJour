# MeditationJournal

An app supporting meditation students in their practice and journaling.

Especially when learning meditate it can be daunting to hold your focus without getting distracted by whether the meditation timeInMinutes is correctly setup, you have logged your preparation timeInMinutes and having your journal always on hand to immediately take notes afterwards.

This app takes care of this all. Following the C.MI. course rules, it guides the meditator through the process from setup to review. It automatically keeps track of the times needed for logging, offers recall sounds or meditation audio and stores each jounral entry ready for future rereading and submission.

That said, the app also offers a free flavor so other users, who just want to journal their meditations for personal use. These user can opt to use course-specific audio for a small charge and the __ flavor is sustained by non-instrusive ads.

## Used Libraries and Apis:

* AAC (Room, ViewModel)
* Android-PdfMyXml
* Butterknife
* Timber
* Youtube Player API

## Current status

The app is still being developed in a stand-alone form. Once completed it will be further adapted based on the needs of the course organisers. This will include replacing the YoutTube Player by exoplayer, to provide the course-specific meditation audio. See the design for a detailed overview of what is to come.
